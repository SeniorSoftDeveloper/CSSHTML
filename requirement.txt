step_3_coinlist:
only in full-screen there are 3 colums - while 3 should be possible also in popup-size and on tablets
we addet a secon Text-line and the Text is not centered anymore
it should be centered vertically with 1, 2 and 3 lines of Text
and as you see @Stellar on the left bottom, when I add some text a linebreak happenes


step_4_donate:	
the 2 red Blocks on the right should always be centered vertically
the Text-Block can have 2 or 4 Lines of text
and when one line is longer then the current Line Nr.4 also a LineBreak happenes while there is space left
the left Block with Coin-Icon, Coin-Name and 'Change-Token' can have a static sice aslong '	' or 'Ethereum' fit into
and as you see in scrrenshot #3 vertical center is our main problem
the little blue info-i should popup it's text also on mobile devices and should be in vertical center to the text-line
and screenshot #4, the fields email and message should end on same height

step_5_donated
the content left and right of the wr-code need to be in vertical center
woth have dynamic content, text can be one to fifle lines each
	
step_6_donated_success
using the css-classes success-box, success-left and success-right the right image is not centered horizontal

step_7_donated_error_1:
the retry-button could have a static width and be centered horizontal
